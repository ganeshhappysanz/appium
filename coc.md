## Code of Conduct


### Purpose

Appium is a piece of technology, but **the core of the Appium community is the people in it**. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, socioeconomic status, religion (or lack thereof), or other marginalized aspect of comunity members. We expect all members of the Appium community to abide by this Code of Conduct whenever interacting in online or in-person venues (pull requests, GitHub issues, 1-1 or group chat, meetups, conferences, etc...)


### Examples of Inappropriate Behavior

Because we come from a variety of backgrounds, we don't want to assume that everyone has the same assumptions about what is and isn't appropriate. Here are some examples of inappropriate behavior that are incompatible with our community's ethos:

* Spamming, trolling, intentionally disrupting conversations, or irrelevant solicitation or advertisement
* Making demeaning or discriminatory remarks or comments
* Making assumptions about someone's background, abilities, or intentions
* Harrassing or stalking individuals (online or in person)
* Giving someone unwelcome sexual attention or making unwelcome physical contact (in the case of an IRL event)
* Sharing sexual images or using sexually explicit language

In general: treat others how you would like to be treated, were you in their place. Don't be a jerk. _Do_ ask questions. _Do_ keep conflicts productively focused on technical issues. _Do_ think before you speak: what is a funny witticism in your group of friends might be hurtful or reinforce hurtful stereotypes. _Do_ remember that we are all people, not robots, and all deserving of sensitivity and respect. (And if and when robots join our community, let's treat them with respect too!)


### What will we do about inappropriate behavior?

If we notice you doing or saying something appropriate, we'll explain why it's inappropriate and ask you to stop. We won't demonize or vilify you. But please do stop the inappropriate behavior so we can get back to writing and discussing code. If you have philosophical disagreements about what's actually inappropriate, please take them to a separate public or private conversation with an Appium maintainer so we don't turn pull requests into an ethics course.

If you keep doing unacceptable things, we'll likely ban you or do something similar.

### What if I see or am subject to inappropriate behavior?

Let us know! Please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Full contact information is listed in the [Contact Info](#contact-info) section of this document. All communications will be kept strictly confidential, unless otherwise required by law. No issue will be considered too inconsequential or unimportant for us to have a conversation about.
